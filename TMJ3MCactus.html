                    the ends were filed down for safety. The 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cut to

                    the base.

                    &emsp;&#10146; Using magnets, the already welded arms should be welded to the stem such that every
                    angle is 90&deg; and that the tubing walls are continuous<br>
                    &emsp;&#10146; In a similar process to getting the arms welded, if the arms are off, hammer them off
                    and try again<br>
                    &emsp;&#10146; Once the arms are in the correct position, finishing welds were applied then ground
                    off<br>
                    <i>Comments:</i> Welding the arms to the stem actually took more attemps than welding the arms
                    together. For some reason, the the tack welds kept being tilted; this unfortunatly happened to both
                    arms multiple times.

                    <i>Comments:</i> It was somewhat difficult getting the stem square since I couldn't use a
                    square to tell if the stem was square. This meant eyeballing it and hoping I got close enough, after
                    consulting people I finally felt confidant enough to apply the finishing welds.
